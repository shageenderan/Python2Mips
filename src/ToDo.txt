To Do
 [DONE] Print: add support to accept multiple arguments: print("testVal", val)
 [DONE] Input: add support for int(input())
 [DONE] Add suport for string concatenation, i.e. print("hello " + " world")
 [DONE] Add variable assignment support, i.e. x = 10
 [DONE] Add support for arithmetic operations
 [DONE] Fix parser to only add a string to dataStack if its not already in dataStack
 [DONE] Update parser to switch between storing string or .space

 [DONE] Convert Arthimetic print tokens
    -[FIXED] Fix translate not handling {left: previous, right: next} properly. Some test cases to reproduce error:
        print((2*2 + 3*4) * 45/50)
        print(45/50 * (2*2 + 3*4)) - results in infinite loop
        Has to do with how {right: next} is handled.
 [DONE] Add support for casting values i.e. x = 10; str(x)
 [DONE] Translate input statements
 [DONE] Differentiate between integer and string variables. 
 [DONE] Translate variable assignment statements

Important
 - Unit tests for input translations
 - Unit tests for variable assignment translations
 - translation for comments
 - if/else loops
 

Small/Optional
 - Add function to reduce print/ input args. i.e. print("hello" + "world") reduces to print("hello world") or print(3 + 3) 
   reduces to print(6)

Not Supporting:
1) redeclaring variables i.e.:
      x = "hello"
      print(x)
      x = 6
      print(x)
  reason: won't know how to allocate for variable (.space or .word), dont be stingy with variable declarations :)
2) floating point numbers
  reason: out of scope
3) classes
  reason: out of scope
4) file manipulation(for now, might change)
  reason: out of scope
